## Hello :)
## To see my workshops please go [here](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam)

## I am a data scientist working @IBM.
## My interests are:

   * ### Machine Learning
   I engage in projects as [ML Engineer](https://www.credly.com/badges/6d6d21e9-eec4-463b-8f22-22d409103563) and as [Data Scientist](https://www.credly.com/badges/2d6770d6-c2eb-429f-bcdd-614e4327bf72). Please see my some notes about [my latest ML project](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watson_insurance/) (code itself is proprietary). In this project I have used tweedie regressor to count pure premium for insurance product and the whole thing (transfomer with model) was hosted on Watson Machine Learning and was using Watson OpenScale monitors to check model for bias, explainability, fairness and drift.
   * ### Optimization
   Please see my two [optimization workshops](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam/) I made for my clients. Decision Optimization (aka prescriptive analytics) is great way to enhance your machine learning projects and to approach problems from different perspective.
   For optimization projects I am using CPLEX, and DOcplex, two IBM libraries that can help build our dynamic programming models efficiently.
   * ### neuro-symbolic AI
   It's always beneficial to attend a good summer school like [this one](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/events/ns-summerschool2022/). Neural-symbolic AI is a kind of deductive system allowing you to put reasoning layer on top of your neural nets.
   You will find general info about neural-symbolic AI [here](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/). 
   If you want hands on experience, take [this neural-symbolic AI badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/a9c7f8c5-5d62-4437-aa57-977f779b21d5/linked_in?t=rh42yg).
   * ### Qiskit
   In 2020 I have spent the summer learning about Qiskit were I contributed and attended [hackathons](https://www.credly.com/badges/7e4653bd-141a-4280-8544-f345fb7232be). It goes in pair with my another interest - optimization.
