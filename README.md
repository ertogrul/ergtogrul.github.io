## Hello :)
## To see my workshops please go [here](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam)

## I am a data scientist working @IBM.
## My interests are:

   * ### Machine Learning
   Please see my some notes about my [latest ML project](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watson_insurance/) (code itself is proprietary).
   * ### Optimization
   Please see some [optimization workshops](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam/)  I made for my clients.
   * ### neuro-symbolic AI
   It's always beneficial to attend a good summer school. Neural-symbolic AI is kind of deductive system allowing you to put reasoning layer on top of your neural nets :)  
   You will find general info about neural-symbolic AI [here](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/). 
   It was very educative and opening to make [this neural-symbolic AI badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/a9c7f8c5-5d62-4437-aa57-977f779b21d5/linked_in?t=rh42yg).
   * ### Qiskit
   In 2020 I have spent the summer on learning about Qiskit were I contributed and attended [hackathons](https://www.credly.com/badges/7e4653bd-141a-4280-8544-f345fb7232be). It goes in pair with my another interest - optimization.
