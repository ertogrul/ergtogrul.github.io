## Hello :)
## To see my workshops please go [here](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam)

## I am a data scientist working @IBM.
## My interests are:

   * ### Machine Learning
   Please see my some notes about [my latest ML project](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watson_insurance/) (code itself is proprietary). I am using tweedie regressor to count pure premium for insurance product and the whole thing (transfomer with model) is hosted on Watson Machine Learning and is using Watson OpenScale monitors to check model for bias, explainability, fainress and drift.
   * ### Optimization
   Please see some [optimization workshops](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam/)  I made for my clients. Decision Optimization is great way to enhance your machine learning projects and give more fresh insigths. 
   For optimization projects I am using CPLEX, library from IBM implement optimization efficiently.
   * ### neuro-symbolic AI
   It's always beneficial to attend a good summer school like [this one](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/events/ns-summerschool2022/). Neural-symbolic AI is a kind of deductive system allowing you to put reasoning layer on top of your neural nets.
   You will find general info about neural-symbolic AI [here](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/). 
   If you want hands on experience, take [this neural-symbolic AI badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/a9c7f8c5-5d62-4437-aa57-977f779b21d5/linked_in?t=rh42yg).
   * ### Qiskit
   In 2020 I have spent the summer on learning about Qiskit were I contributed and attended [hackathons](https://www.credly.com/badges/7e4653bd-141a-4280-8544-f345fb7232be). It goes in pair with my another interest - optimization.
