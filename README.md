## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am a data scientist working @IBM.
## My interests are:

   * ### Machine Learning (with Explainability & Fairness)
   I engage in projects as a [ML Engineer](https://www.credly.com/badges/6d6d21e9-eec4-463b-8f22-22d409103563) and as a [Data Scientist](https://www.credly.com/badges/2d6770d6-c2eb-429f-bcdd-614e4327bf72). As an example, see the notes about [my latest ML project](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watson_insurance/). In this project I have used tweedie regressor with transformers to count pure premium for insurance product. Model and transformer were hosted on Watson Machine Learning and they used Watson OpenScale monitors to scan bias, explainability, fairness and drift.
   * ### Optimization
   Please see my two [Decision Optimization workshops](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam/) that I made for my clients. Decision Optimization (aka prescriptive analytics) is a great way to enrich machine learning projects.
   For optimization projects I am using CPLEX, and DOcplex, two IBM libraries that can help build our dynamic programming models efficiently.
   
   * ### Visual Recognition
   Using Detectron framework on IBM platfrom named Maximo Visual Inspection I have created a model where client's AGV carts were inspected for security, giving great value of automated daily security checks. Watch [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keC8Tnj8OJ8&ab_channel=IBMDeveloper) for more information. 
   
   * ### Neuro-symbolic AI
   It's always beneficial to attend a good summer school like [this one](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/events/ns-summerschool2022/). Neural-symbolic AI is kind of deductive system allowing you to put a reasoning layer on top of your neural nets.
   You will find general info about neural-symbolic AI [here](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/). 
   If you want hands on experience, take [this badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/a9c7f8c5-5d62-4437-aa57-977f779b21d5/linked_in?t=rh42yg).
   * ### Qiskit
   In 2020 I have spent a summer (and few consecutive months) learning about [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), brilliant Python SDK for quantum programming. I have contributed to Qiskit in many ways, attended [hackathons](https://www.credly.com/badges/7e4653bd-141a-4280-8544-f345fb7232be), and enjoyed being the part of the community. I am glad IBM is making such risky bets. Google's Larry Page famously said: "Especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change."
